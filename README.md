## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of modern crypto trading infrastructure.

First, it's crucial to clarify a common misconception: **A token-burn-tracker itself is not a trading bot.** It is a data source, a specialized oracle for on-chain burn events.

Its integration with major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management is an indirect process that happens through a custom-built trading system. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of how this integration works.

### The Core Concept: The "Burn" as a Signal

Token burns (permanently removing tokens from circulation) are often seen as a bullish, deflationary signal. The logic for automation is:

1.  **Track:** Monitor a specific token's smart contract for burn transactions.
2.  **Analyze:** Calculate the magnitude and frequency of the burn (e.g., $1M burned in the last hour, or a 0.5% of supply burned today).
3.  **Execute:** Use this analysis to trigger buy or sell orders on an exchange.
4.  **Manage:** Adjust overall portfolio allocation based on the burn's impact on the token's projected scarcity.
